# SQL Practice Repository

This repository contains my structured SQL practice from basics to advanced concepts.
Each SQL file is organized topic-wise and includes clear notes, key points,
and question–answer based SQL queries for learning and revision.

The goal of this repository is to build strong SQL fundamentals
through consistent hands-on practice and real-world examples.
